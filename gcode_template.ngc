; Touch off for this workpiece:

G21      ; use mm
G90      ; absolute coordinates
G92.1    ; cancel offset coordinate system and set values to zero
G54      ; use G54 coordinate system
G40      ; turn radius compensation off
G17      ; choose x,y plane
G80      ; Cancel Motion Modes (e.g. active canned cycles)
G94      ; movement speed is in units per minute (hence mm/min)
G49      ; turn cutter legth compensation off
; It is always a good idea to go to a known safe location to run the warmup
G0 Z10   ; Go to saftyplane, usually you define the highest part of your workpiece as Z=0
; Spindle Warmup Sequence
M3       ; turn on spindle
; TODO set the right spindle speed here
S6000    ; 6000 min-1 spindle speed
;G4 P120  ; wait 2 minutes until spindle is warm
;S12000   ; add another 6000min-1
;G4 P120  ; again two minute wait
(repeat steps above [S + G4] until target speed is reached)

; TODO set this value correctly
#<_plungerate> = 800
#<_feedrate> = 4000

F#<_feedrate>

(your program starts here... now you can do things like)
G0 X0 Y0 ; go to your 0,0 point rapidly
G4 P0    ; Dwell for no time, to force linuxcnc to be on this point exactly



; the tail
G0 Z10   ; retract from workplane - safty plane
M30      ; end program
